# Obsidian Plugin Manager Constitution

A plugin for managing all installed Obsidian plugins with a focus on keyboard-only interaction for efficiency.

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design
The plugin must be intuitive and easy to use for all users, regardless of their technical expertise. All features should be discoverable and accessible with minimal friction.
*Rationale: The primary goal is to simplify plugin management, not add another layer of complexity.*

### II. Reliability and Stability
The plugin must not cause Obsidian to crash or behave unexpectedly. All changes made by the plugin (installing, uninstalling, enabling, disabling) must be atomic and reversible where possible.
*Rationale: A tool designed to manage other tools must be itself completely reliable.*

### III. Performance as a Feature
The plugin must be fast and responsive. It should not introduce any noticeable lag or performance degradation to Obsidian's startup time or general usage.
*Rationale: Users expect their tools to be snappy. A slow plugin manager will be quickly abandoned.*

### IV. Security and Trust
The plugin must not introduce security vulnerabilities. It should only interact with the official Obsidian plugin registry and trusted sources like BRAT. Any action that modifies the user's vault must be explicit and clear.
*Rationale: Users trust this plugin with access to their vault. That trust is paramount.*

### V. Maintainability and Extensibility
The codebase must be clean, well-documented, and easy to understand. It should be possible for new contributors to get up to speed quickly. The architecture should allow for new features and actions to be added without major refactoring.
*Rationale: A healthy project is one that can be maintained and improved over time.*

## Governance

This constitution is the supreme governing document for the Obsidian Plugin Manager project. All development, contributions, and reviews must adhere to its principles.

Amendments to this constitution require a pull request, a clear rationale, and approval from the project maintainers. The version number must be incremented according to Semantic Versioning based on the nature of the change.

# Implementation Plan: Highlight Matched Text in Search Results

**Branch**: `001-highlight-matched-text` | **Date**: 2025-10-25 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Summary

This feature will highlight the parts of a plugin's name in the search results that match the user's fuzzy search query. The goal is to provide immediate visual feedback to the user, so they can quickly understand why a particular result is shown. The highlighting will be driven by the match indices provided by Obsidian's built-in fuzzy search modal.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9.3
**Primary Dependencies**: Obsidian API, esbuild
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: No testing framework is currently set up in the project.]
**Target Platform**: Obsidian (Desktop and Mobile)
**Project Type**: Single project (Obsidian plugin)
**Performance Goals**: Highlighting should introduce no noticeable lag to the search experience.
**Constraints**: The implementation must use the match indices from the `FuzzyMatch` object provided by the built-in Obsidian `FuzzySuggestModal`.
**Scale/Scope**: This feature applies to all plugins listed in the plugin manager.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **User-Centric Design**: Does the proposed feature prioritize ease of use and a clear user experience?
  - **PASS**: Yes, this feature directly improves UX by making search results easier to understand.
- **Reliability and Stability**: What is the potential impact of this feature on the stability of the plugin and Obsidian?
  - **PASS**: The impact is low. The feature is a visual enhancement within an existing UI component.
- **Performance as a Feature**: Has the performance impact of this feature been considered?
  - **PASS**: Yes. The performance goal is to have no noticeable lag. The implementation will be a simple DOM manipulation based on data already provided by the API.
- **Security and Trust**: Does this feature introduce any new security risks?
  - **PASS**: No. This is a client-side rendering feature with no new data sources or external calls.
- **Maintainability and Extensibility**: Is the proposed implementation clean, documented, and extensible?
  - **PASS**: Yes, the plan is to contain the logic within the existing `renderSuggestion` method, which is maintainable.

### Source Code (repository root)

```text
# Single project (Obsidian Plugin)
main.ts
```

**Structure Decision**: The project is a single-file Obsidian plugin. All new logic will be added to the existing `PluginManagerModal` class within `main.ts`.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

# Feature Specification: Highlight Matched Text in Search Results

**Feature Branch**: `001-highlight-matched-text`
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "when the plugin is filtering plugin names with user input, it should mark the matched texts in the results with a different style (bold)."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Highlight Matched Text (Priority: P1)

As a user searching for plugins, I want the parts of the plugin name that match my search query to be highlighted, so that I can quickly see why a particular result was returned.

**Why this priority**: This is a core usability feature that directly impacts the user's ability to understand search results.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by searching for a plugin and visually verifying that the matched text in the plugin name is highlighted in the search results list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has opened the plugin manager search, **When** the user types "man", **Then** the substring "man" in any plugin name like "Plugin Manager" must be highlighted.
2. **Given** the user is searching for plugins, **When** the user types "plug", **Then** the substring "Plug" in "Plugin Manager" must be highlighted, demonstrating case-insensitivity.
3. **Given** the user is searching for plugins, **When** the user types "dv", **Then** the characters 'd' and 'v' in "dataview" must be highlighted, demonstrating fuzzy matching.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the search query has no matches? (No special handling needed, as no results will be displayed for highlighting).
- How does the system handle case-insensitive matching? (The matched text in the plugin name should be highlighted regardless of the case of the search query).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST use the match indices provided by Obsidian's fuzzy search modal to highlight the corresponding characters in the plugin name.
- **FR-002**: The highlighting style MUST be visually distinct (e.g., bold text).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST NOT highlight matches in the plugin description.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-25

- Q: Should highlighting be applied only to the plugin name, or to the description as well? → A: Name only
- Q: How should the search handle special characters in the user's input? → A: Literal search
- Q: How should highlighting work for fuzzy matches? → A: The highlighting must use the match indices provided by the built-in fuzzy search modal to highlight non-contiguous characters.

## Assumptions

- This feature will be implemented within the existing search result rendering logic.
- There are no external dependencies required for this feature.
- The implementation assumes that the `match.matches` property of the `FuzzyMatch` object provided by the Obsidian API accurately reflects the characters to be highlighted.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of visible search results that match the query must have the corresponding text segment highlighted.
- **SC-002**: A user can identify why a search result is returned (by seeing the highlighted text) in under 1 second of viewing the result.

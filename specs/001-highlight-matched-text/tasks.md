# Tasks: Highlight Matched Text in Search Results

**Input**: Design documents from `.`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, quickstart.md

## Phase 1: User Story 1 - Highlight Matched Text (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Provide visual feedback to the user by highlighting the parts of a plugin's name that match the search query.

**Independent Test**: Search for a plugin and verify that the matched text is highlighted as per the scenarios in `quickstart.md`.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T001 [US1] Modify the `renderSuggestion` method in `main.ts` to use the `item.match.matches` data to wrap matched characters in a `<strong>` tag.
- [x] T002 [US1] Add a CSS rule to `styles.css` for the highlighting style to ensure it is visually distinct and consistent with the theme.
- [x] T003 [US1] Manually test the feature according to the steps outlined in `quickstart.md` to ensure all acceptance criteria are met.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **T001** is the core implementation task and must be completed first.
- **T002** can be done in parallel with T001.
- **T003** must be done after T001 and T002 are complete.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1.  Complete all tasks for User Story 1.
